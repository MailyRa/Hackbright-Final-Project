## Introduction:

In one of my previous jobs I worked as a Service Manager for Wells Fargo Bank. Because of this experience, I wanted to create a tool 
that could help people obtain more information about financial products.  In this website you are able to browse loans by category, which includes,
home, personal, educational, business, and car loans. From the search page users are also able to filter their loans 
by government vs private loans, and credit unions vs large banks. From this page the user 
can save the loan to their profile or they can find the nearest banks which offer a particular
loan. Users can also compare different loans side by side to make it easier for them to 
visualize their different options.


### Landing Page
Users register or login on the React JS built landing page

### Filters
From the search page user are able to filter their loans by category, government loans vs private loans, and for those who prefer to stay away
from big banks there is an option to view loans from credit unions.

### Locating Bank Nearby
For the map feature I used the Google Maps API to search for nearby locations and to display the locations on a map for the user to visualize.

The user has the option to select the buttons to compare different loans to each other

### Comparing Loans 
Users can also compare different loans side by side to make it easier for the user to visualize when making the difference between their different options.
