## Introduction:

In one of my previous jobs I worked as a Service Manager for Wells Fargo Bank. Because of this experience, I wanted to create a tool 
that could help people obtain more information about financial products. 


### Features:
 
- Display loans by category such as: home, personal, educational, business and auto loans.
- Filter loans by Government loans and/or Credit Unions.
- Compare different loans side by side to make it easier for to visualize when choosing between different options.
- Save loans to your profile
- Find the nearest banks which offer a particular loan.


### Landing Page
Users register or login on the React JS built landing page

### Activate Loan Dashboard 
Once signed in, the user can browse the different loans by category which includes, home, personal, educational, business, and car loans.

### Filters
From the search page users are able to filter their loans by category, government loans vs private loans, and for those who prefer to stay away
from big banks there is an option to view loans from credit unions.

### Locating Nearby Banks
For the map feature I used the Google Maps API to search for nearby locations and to display the locations on a map for the user to visualize.

### Compare Loans
The user has the option to select which loans they would like to compare.

From there users can view different loans side by side to make it easier for the user to visualize the differences between these financial products and institutions.
